# Speed up writing tests with Wiremock Spring Boot


This repository complements my [Speed up writing tests with Wiremock Spring Boot](https://brussels.voxxeddays.com/talk/?id=3926) quickie on Voxxed Days Brussels 2024. It contains:
* A client connecting to the Jsonplaceholder Todo API
* Unittests for the client
* Wiremock mappings in json files
* The equivalent mapping in code in the unittests
* Sample http calls to jsonplaceholder API and to the ``/todos/all`` endpoint of this application
